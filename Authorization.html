  <p>The Google Sheets add-on <i><?= addonTitle ?></i> is set to run automatically. 
    However the add-on was recently updated and it needs you to re-authorize it to 
    run on your behalf.</p>

  <p>The daily check of the <i><?= addonTitle ?></i> calendar for new tasks is 
    temporarily disabled until you re-authorize it. To do so, open Google Sheets 
    and run the "Add-ons > <?= addonTitle ?> > Check calendar for tasks" menu option. 
    Alternatively, you can click this link:</p>

  <p><a href="<?= url ?>">Re-authorize the add-on.</a></p>

  <p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the
  add-on is re-authorized.</p>
  
  <p>If you no longer use RTM and wish to uninstall it, which will stop these 
  "re-auth" emails, go into any <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/">Google sheet</a>, click 
  Add-ons > Manage add-ons > The "Manage" button for Rose Task Manager and then Remove.</p>

  <p>Please drop me a line if you have any questions.</p>

  <p>Yours,</p>
