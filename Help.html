  <p>The Rose Task Manager add-on provides an ideal way to manage your own tasks and those 
  of your team. </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>GForm for submitting task requests</li>
  <li>Scheduling of regular or on-off tasks using the Google Calendar</li>
  <li>Email notifications of new task listings or status updates</li>
  <li>Customised email templates using GMail drafts</li>
  <li>Supports customisation of GForm and task list GSheet</li>
  <li>Automatically completes task start and end time in the task list on status updates</li>
  <li>Progress "Log" tab</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Usage</h3>
    
  <h4>Submit a new task</h4>
  
  <p>Open the task request form (Form > Go to live form) and submit a task. You'll see 
  the task listed in the "Task List" tab and the user and the list admin/owner will receive 
  an email notification.</p>
  
  <p>A link to the request form can be shared with your team or organisation to allow them to 
  submit task requests, or simply bookmark it for yourself to use.</p>
  
  <h4>Set up a scheduled task</h4> 
  
  <p>Open the <a href='https://www.google.com/calendar'>Rose Task Manager calendar</a> and add 
  events you would like to schedule to appear on the task list sheet. Event length is ignored, 
  so just make a full day event</p>
  
  <p>Every day the calendar is automatically checked (4am GMT), that day's tasks appear on the task 
  list and you'll receive an email notification. </p>
  
  <p>The RTM calendar is produced alongside the default 
  calendar provided by your Google account, see the <a href='https://support.google.com/calendar/?hl=en#topic=6076998'>Google support pages</a> 
  for more information on creating events and managing multiple calendars.</p>
  
  <p>The name of the calendar can be changed.</p>
  
  <p>The calendar can be manually checked at any time using "Add-ons > Rose Task Manager > Check calendar for tasks".</p>
  
  <h4>Customise an email notification</h4>
  
  <p>Create a draft email to use as an email template, using placeholders of the form "{{PLACE_HOLDER}}", 
  where PLACE_HOLDER is header of the column to take a value from.
  
  <p>For example, say you wanted the task "Description" to be included in the email the placeholder would be "{{Description}}". 
  
  <p>Open the settings sidebar - "Add-ons > Rose Task Manager > Settings" - and select the draft email from the 
  "New Task" dropdown list.</p>
  
  <p>Any "new task" email notifications will now use this template.</p>
  
  <p>The "Status Update" email notifications can be similarly customised.</p>

  <h4>Send a "Status update" email</h4>
  
  <p>Click on any cell in a row in the task list and then "Add-ons > Rose Task Manager > Send Status email".</p>
      
  <h3>Installation creates:</h3>

  <ul>
  
    <li>A <strong>new sheet called "Task List"</strong>. DO NOT RENAME THIS SHEET.
    
    <li>A <strong>new sheet called "Fields"</strong> that is used for validating the Priority 
    and Status values. DO NOT RENAME THIS SHEET.
    
    <li>A <strong>Google Form</strong> (Form > Go to live form) for entering tasks into the 
    task list.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Task email notifications.</strong> Submitting a task via the task request 
    form sends an email notification to the user and the owner of the task list.</li>
        
    <li>A <strong><a href='https://www.google.com/calendar'>Google Calendar called "Rose Task Manager"</a>.
    </strong> The calendar can be renamed.</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h3>History</h3>

  <p>RTM was originally conceived as a CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) to allow 
  regular maintenance tasks to be scheduled and allow facilities to submit ad-hoc maintenance tasks.
