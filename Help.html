  <p>Rose Task Manager provides an ideal way to manage your own tasks or those 
  of your team. It supports the scheduling of regular tasks using the Google 
  Calendar and can send email notifications of task listings or status updates to all 
  involved. It also automatically completes task start and end time in the task list 
  spreadsheet, and copes with columns being added or moved around.</p>
  
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <ul>
    
    <li><strong>Open the task request form (Form > Go to live form) and submit a task.</strong> 
    You'll see the task listed in the "Task List" sheet and the user and the list admin/owner will 
    receive an email notification.</li>

    <li><strong>Open the <a href='https://www.google.com/calendar'>Rose Task 
    Manager calendar</a> and add events you would like to schedule to appear as tasks 
    on the task list sheet</strong>. These can be one-off or regular tasks. Every 
    night the calendar will be checked, you will see that day's tasks on the task 
    list and you'll receive an email notification. This calendar is produced alongside 
    the default calendar provided by your Google account, see the 
    <a href='https://support.google.com/calendar/?hl=en#topic=6076998'>Google support pages</a> 
    for more information on creating events and managing multiple calendars.</li>

    <li><strong>Share a link to the request form with your team or organisation</strong> to 
    allow them to submit task requests, or bookmark it for yourself to use.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Send a status update email to a submitter</strong> by clicking on a row 
    to select it and using Add-ons > Rose Task Manager > Send Status email.</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Installation creates:</h3>

  <ul>
  
    <li>A <strong>new sheet called Task List</strong>. DO NOT RENAME THIS SHEET.
    
    <li>A <strong>new sheet called Fields</strong> that is used for validating the Priority 
    and Status values. DO NOT RENAME THIS SHEET.
    
    <li>A <strong>Google Form</strong> (Form > Go to live form) for entering tasks into the 
    task list.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Task email notifications.</strong> Submitting a task via the task request 
    form sends an email notification to the user and the owner of the task list.</li>
        
    <li>A <strong><a href='https://www.google.com/calendar'>Google Calendar called Rose Task Manager</a>.
    </strong> The script automatically runs every night, converting calendar events for that 
    day into tasks in the task list sheet. This allows you to take advantage of the calendar's 
    scheduling ability to create regular tasks.  This calendar is produced alongside the default 
    calendar provided by your Google account, see the 
    <a href='https://support.google.com/calendar/?hl=en#topic=6076998'>Google support pages</a> 
    for more information on creating event and managing multiple calendars.</li>
    
  </ul>
